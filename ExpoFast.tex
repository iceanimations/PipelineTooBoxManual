\section{ExpoFast}

Originally developed as “Expo Cam” to export the camera from the scenes, later
the options to export the shaders and light were also provided by the tool so
I named it as “Expo Fast” as it quickly opens the scene files and exports the
objects from the scene. User can select the object type to be exported the
tool will list the objects and then click on the export button the objects
will be exported to the specified location. User can export objects as
separate files or he/she can export them as single file.

\subsection*{Features}
